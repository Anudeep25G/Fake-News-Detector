## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/verity-fake-news.git
cd verity-fake-news
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the Model
```bash
python train_model.py
```
This generates `model/model.pkl` and `model/vectorizer.pkl`.

### 4. Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Open your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🧠 How It Works

```
User Input (News Text)
        ↓
   Text Cleaning
  (lowercase, remove URLs, digits, punctuation)
        ↓
  TF-IDF Vectorization
  (50,000 features, unigrams + bigrams)
        ↓
  Logistic Regression
  (trained on balanced Fake/Real dataset)
        ↓
  Verdict + Confidence Score
  (Real ✦ or Fake ✕)
```

### Key Training Decisions
- **Reuters source tag removed** from True.csv to prevent data leakage
- **Title weighted 2×** by repetition in the combined feature string
- **Stratified train/test split** to maintain class balance
- **`min_df=3`, `max_df=0.85`** to filter noisy and overly common tokens
- **`sublinear_tf=True`** to reduce dominance of long articles

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | ~95%+ |
| Classifier | Logistic Regression |
| Features | TF-IDF (1,2)-grams |
| Train/Test Split | 80% / 20% |
| Cross-Validation | 5-fold F1 |

## ☁️ Deployment

This app is deployable on **Streamlit Cloud** for free.

1. Push the repository to GitHub
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Select your repo, set `app.py` as the entry point
4. Click **Deploy**

> If `.pkl` files exceed 100MB, use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) or add a train-on-startup script.
